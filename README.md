Introduction
Kotlin is a statically-typed, modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is fully interoperable with Java, which makes it ideal for developing Android applications and backend systems. This course will teach you the fundamentals of Kotlin, providing a solid foundation to build your coding skills.

Prerequisites
This course is designed for absolute beginners, so no prior programming experience is required. However, some basic knowledge of programming concepts (variables, loops, and functions) is helpful.

If you're familiar with Java or any object-oriented programming language, youâ€™ll find Kotlin even easier to grasp!

Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Understand the syntax and structure of Kotlin code
Write basic Kotlin programs
Use control flow (if/else, loops) to make decisions in your code
Create and call functions
Work with classes and objects using object-oriented programming principles
Handle errors and exceptions in Kotlin
Build a simple Kotlin application
Setup Instructions
To get started, you'll need to set up your development environment:

Install IntelliJ IDEA: The recommended IDE for Kotlin development.

Download from: IntelliJ IDEA Download
Install Kotlin: Kotlin is already included in IntelliJ IDEA, but if you prefer to use another IDE, you can follow the installation instructions at the official Kotlin website: Kotlin Installation.

Create a New Kotlin Project: Open IntelliJ IDEA, create a new project, and select Kotlin as the language.

Run Your First Program: Start writing Kotlin code in your Main.kt file.
